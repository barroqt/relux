Relux is a Blockchain-Backed Luxury Marketplace where sellers can list certified and tokenised luxury goods.

Relux is a mobile and web platform that lists luxury items certified by their manufacturers, ensuring that buyers receive authentic products. Each item on Relux is tokenized and represented by a unique NFT, providing traceability and security. Upon purchase, the NFT is transferred to the buyer, creating a verifiable on-chain record of ownership. Relux combats contraband and guarantees the authenticity of luxury goods, offering buyers confidence and assurance.

Cross border payments are made frictionless with USDC, a dollar-backed currency. The entire world shares the same marketplace.

The marketplace is deployed on multiple Layer 2 networks (including Scroll, Zircuit, Base, and Arbitrum). This multi-chain approach enhances scalability and keeps transaction costs extremely low for users.
